# Privacy Policy for Shippi SmartTicket Assistant

## Data Collection and Usage

This extension collects and processes the following data:
- Ticket content (descriptions and comments) that you explicitly choose to enhance
- Your OpenAI API key (stored securely in Chrome's encrypted storage)
- Extension settings and preferences

### How We Handle Your Data

1. **API Key Storage**: Your OpenAI API key is stored securely using Chrome's built-in encrypted storage system (chrome.storage.sync). The key is only used to make API calls to OpenAI's services.

2. **Ticket Content**: When you choose to enhance a comment or description:
   - The content is sent to OpenAI's API for processing
   - A local cache of enhanced content is temporarily stored to improve performance
   - No content is permanently stored or transmitted to any other third parties

3. **Settings**: Your preferences (enhancement style, intensity, etc.) are stored locally using Chrome's storage API.

### Data Security

- All communication with OpenAI's API is done over secure HTTPS connections
- The extension requests minimal permissions necessary for functionality
- No user data is collected for analytics or tracking purposes

### Third-Party Services

This extension interacts with:
- OpenAI's API (using your provided API key)
- Your project management platform (through your existing authenticated session)

### Your Rights

You can:
- Clear all stored data through Chrome's extension management
- Remove your API key at any time
- Disable or uninstall the extension to stop all data processing
